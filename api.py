# The GET Method -
# GET is used to request data from a
# specified resource. When you access
# a websiteâ€™s page, your browser
# makes a get request to your API and
# your API is returning the front-end
# that is displayed in the browser.


# The POST Method -
# POST is used to send data to the
# server to create/update a resource.


# The PUT Method -
# PUT is used to send data to a server
# to create / update a resource.


# The DELETE Method -
# DELETE is used to delete a resource.



# GET is the default method


# Difference between POST and PUT

# The basic difference between PUT
# and POST is that a POST request is
# when you can create multiple copies
# of the same resource.

# A PUT request, on the other hand
# means that you want to create only
# one copy of the resource, i.e. Signing
# Up a unique user



# ------- 0   1   2   3 ---> positive indexing

# x =    23  34  45  89

# <----  -4  -3  -2  -1 ----- negative  indexing  ~ x[-1] --> 89
